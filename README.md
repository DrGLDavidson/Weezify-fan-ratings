This repository contains an R script for visualising and summarising the fan ratings across bundles. 

There are two outputs: 

1. A figure showing the ratings of each song per bundle (each song is a datapoint), with boxplots (median, quartiles etc). The black dot and line are the means and standard error for each bundle. i.e. average fan rating per bundle.
2. A csv table with the summary of data (means, error and number of songs per bundle).
